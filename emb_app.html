    SVP Worldwide is a leading manufacturer of high-end domestic sewing and embroidery machines (brands include Singer, Husqvarna Viking and Pfaff). These machines have an associated ecosystem of creative digital tools, known as the CREATIVATE.
    <br /><br />
    As part of the team who developed the original desktop embroidery software and expert in embroidery digitizing, I was assigned the task of designing a brand new tablet App experience.

  <p>
    The existing desktop legacy <strong>user base could be a great source</strong> of info to start from. I wanted to find out how the existing user was feeling about the desktop software.
    <br /><br />
    I decided the first step was to write a survey and send it on the newsletter of the existing user base.
    <br />
    The main goal of the survey was to identify what features were <strong>used the most</strong>, the potential <strong>choice of devices</strong> to perform them and the user <strong>impression of his own skills</strong>.
  </p>

  <div class="flex_column padding_vertical">

    <div class="flex_column" style="max-width:800px; height:auto; gap:16px">
      <p class="notes">The graphic below shows how low the users are rating their skills.</p>

    </div>   


  </div>



  <p>By analyzing the survey data, I was able to find the following problems:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><strong>Steep learning curve</strong>: Users feel lost and struggle to find help.</li>
    <li><strong>Feature overload</strong>: Most users only use 20% of features.</li>
    <li><strong>Low self-confidence</strong>: Users feel “not skilled enough” despite years of experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Perceived value gap</strong>: They feel they pay for features they don’t use.</li>

  </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">IDEATION</h2>
  </div>

  <h3 class="subsection-title">A GLOBAL VIEW</h3>

  <p>
    Even if we are aiming for a starting MVP with limited functions, I try to include all the selected must-have features in the app, in order to have the global picture. It is desirable to <strong>perform an incremental development avoiding potential steps back</strong> in the future.
  </p>

  <h3 class="subsection-title">DESIGNING THE UI</h3>

  <p>
    As a starting point when thinking on the UI, I spent some time checking other apps. I could not find any other tablet app for embroidery, but I did check other creative tools such as Photoshop and Illustrator for Ipad, Sketchbook , Nomad (3d Models) and Procreate. I wanted to find the <strong>best practices</strong> on organizing the information, and any <strong>good solid standards</strong> that I could apply on my app.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once I had enough research done, I used the <strong>crazy 8’s brainstorming method</strong>; I came up with different ideas for the main UI, were the necessary elements were placed differently:
  </p>



  <div class="crazy_8_container">

    <img src=images/emb_crazy_8_1.jpg alt="emb_crazy_8_1" class="crazy_8_image" />
    <img src=images/emb_crazy_8_2.jpg alt="emb_crazy_8_2" class="crazy_8_image" />
    <img src=images/emb_crazy_8_3.jpg alt="emb_crazy_8_3" class="crazy_8_image" />
    <img src=images/emb_crazy_8_4.jpg alt="emb_crazy_8_4" class="crazy_8_image" />
    <img src=images/emb_crazy_8_5.jpg alt="emb_crazy_8_5" class="crazy_8_image" />
    <img src=images/emb_crazy_8_6.jpg alt="emb_crazy_8_6" class="crazy_8_image" />
    <img src=images/emb_crazy_8_7.jpg alt="emb_crazy_8_7" class="crazy_8_image" />
    <img src=images/emb_crazy_8_8.jpg alt="emb_crazy_8_8" class="crazy_8_image" />

  </div>

  <p>
   With the quick sketches done, I made <strong>wireframe</strong> versions of the three that I did find were better and made more sense for this type of project. 
  </p>



  <div class="wireframe_container">

    <img src=images/emb_wireframe_1.png alt="wireframe_1" class="wireframe_image" />

    <img src=images/emb_wireframe_2.png alt="wireframe_2" class="wireframe_image" />

    <img src=images/emb_wireframe_3.png alt="wireframe_3" class="wireframe_image" />

  </div>

  <p>At this point I felt I had a winner, and was able to <strong>move into the prototyping phase</strong>, keepin always in mind the following requirements:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>The app is intended to be used by <strong>interacting with both hands</strong>.</li>
    <li>The app will be using both orientations, </strong>landscape and portrait.</li>
    <li>There will be <strong>light and dark</strong> themes available.</li>

  </ul>

<h3 class="subsection-title">LEARNINGS</h3>

<p>
  This project for me came with <strong>a lot of responsibility</strong> since the beginning. The app as heir of the desktop legacy software came with a load of history and features behind, and now it was up to me to decide what <strong>was going to make it to the app or not</strong>. I always felt I had to be careful about it in order to not disappoint the existing user base. The survey I run at the beginning was extremelly useful.
</p>

<p>
  An additional challenge was to <strong>forget what I already knew about the desktop software</strong> in order to come up with new improved ways of doing each task. Old ways of doing things were always trying to sneak into the new tablet app.
</p>


<p>
  At the stage when I was trying to reduce the clutter in general, I had to rely in icons without labels in order to save space and noise. I realised how the current <strong>line-type style of the icons makes really difficult to express some ideas or features</strong>. This is the reason why the context help and coachmarks are so important to answer the “what does this do?” question..
