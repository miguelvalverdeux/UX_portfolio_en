  <h3 class="subsection-title">THE COMPLEX WORLD OF QUILTS</h3>

  <p>
    The crafting of quilts is not popular everywhere, so it is worth explaining what it is before diving deeper.
  </p>

  <p>
    Quilting is the craft of stitching (by hand or machine) differents pieces of fabric together, with a layer of batting and a backing fabric to make a padded textile. They can have a practical use, like bedcovers, or they can be purely ornamental.
  </p>



  <div>
    Quilting is extremelly popular in North America because of different factors:

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Tradition and heritage</strong>: has been part of American life since colonial times. Families passed down quilts through generations as treasured heirlooms. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Community</strong>: historically, women gathered to sew together, socialize, and support each other. Modern communities continue this social aspect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Resourcefulness</strong>: a quilt often tells family stories or a major life events, and its recognized as an art form.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Personal expression</strong>:  originally quilts were made from leftover fabric scraps. The sense of making something beautiful out of simple materials still appeals today.
      </li>
    </ol>


  </div>

  <h3 class="subsection-title">INTENDED USE</h3>

  <p>
    The Quilting app, unlike the crafting or embroidery one, is <strong>not directly linked to a physical company product</strong>. The app can be used as an assistant to create the quilt in a traditional hand-sewn fashion. Of corse the sewing machines and crafting machine sold by SVP can be used in the process, but the app can also be handy without owning any machine.
  </p>

  <div>
    The Quilt app must have two sides:

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Plan and Create</strong>: It will allow the user on MVP to load preset quilt layouts and insert inside each block of the quilt any block design from the preset library. The user can specify the dimensions of the Quilt as a whole or the blocks, add borders and sashing, modify the coloring of the design. All this must be done with easy and in a way that results ammusing.
      </li>


      <li>
        <strong>Making it real</strong>: once the user is happy with the final design, he can pass to the "Make the Quilt" process. He will be able to check the build instrructions for each individual block design used. He can also check a map of the quilt project where the parts are displayed in different groups (pieces, blocks, wors and quilt). He will also have access to the estimated yardage estimation for each fabric used. The goal of all this info is to reduce to a minimum the chances of error and frustration.
      </li>
    </ol>

  <h3 class="subsection-title">TARGET AUDIENCE</h3>

  <p>
    The target user audience for our app will be quilters, but we consider the full spectrum. On one side we will <strong>try to please the expert quilter</strong>, giving him the tools and precission he requires. But we will deliver something friendly enough to welcome users that are <strong>totally new to the world of quilts</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Based on the information from the survey research and aligned with the new audience goals, I defined the following personas:

<h3 class="subsection-title">OTHER APPS</h3>

<p>
  As part of my preliminary research I wanted to have a look at <strong>what Quilt design products were already available</strong> in the market, such as Electric Quilt or PreQuilt, and their reputation amongst users. I did not really want to get deeply into them, as did not want to influence my design.
</p>

<p>
  Each of the app and tools I checked had a good user base, but <strong>none was intuitive or easy enough</strong> to be the best of all. Each tool had their flaws, and by analizing them I could figure out the needs of the user:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Avoid Complexity</strong>: creation and customization of quilt projects must be friendly, easy and funny. 
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Too much information to manage</strong>: historically, women gathered to sew together, socialize, and support each other. Modern communities continue this social aspect.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Resourcefulness</strong>: getting the design right and in the right scale can be tricky. I would fix this.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Personal expression</strong>: the app must help the user to reduce waste of fabric.
  </li>
</ul>

  <h3 class="subsection-title">MODULAR BUILD</h3>

  <p>
    For this project I was handed a full set of technical requirements from the Product Owner at the start. On this documentation the overall method of creating a project was mostly figured out. 

  </p>

  <p>


    Essetially, a basic quilt project could be broken appart like this:

  </p>





  <div class="flex_row_wrap" style="gap:32px; justify-content: center;">


    <div  class="flex_column"  style="width:550px; gap:8px; margin:0; line-height:1em;">




      <p style="margin-bottom:0;"> <strong>1.  Quilt</strong><br>
      Its the project as a whole. It is essentially a grid of blocks..</p>


      <p style="margin-bottom:0;"> <strong>2. Quilt Block</strong><br>
      Each cell within the Quilt grid can be empty or contain a design.</p>

      <p style="margin-bottom:0;"> <strong>3. Block Design</strong><br>
      A pattern made of sewn pieces.</p>

      <p style="margin-bottom:0;"> <strong>4. Pieces</strong><br>
      Each of the atoms that make a block design.</p>

      <p style="margin-bottom:0;"> <strong>5. Border and Sashing</strong><br>
      Optional parts that might be used.</p>
    </div>



    <img src="images/qul_quilt_parts.png" alt="quilt_parts" class="shadowed rounded_8" style="max-width :360px; background-color: white; border:1px solid lightgrey; padding: 8px 16px; display: block; " />


  </div>



  <p>
    Now we know the parts of the quilt, we can  understand the modular building method on the app:

  </p>




  <ul style="gap:8px">
    <li>
      The user chooses a layout for the quilt grid, the number of divisons. 
    </li>
    <li>
      The user selects each block and assigns designs to it.
    </li>
    <li>
      The color for pieces can to customized as the user desires.
    </li>
    <li>
      Extra elements like border or sashing can be used.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">PROTOTYPING</h2>
  </div>

  <h3 class="subsection-title">APP COLOR THEME</h3>

  <p>
    Just as I previously did with crafting, I aimed to re-used the already consolidated design system. I had to expand the set of accent colors to include Quilting owns colors.
  </p>

  <p>
    I chose a blue shade for quilting, that felt in <strong>total harmony</strong> with the other two apps, but also <strong>looked so distinctive</strong> and ha it own flavour.
  </p>

  <div class="flex_row_wrap" style="gap:16px; text-align: center">
    <div   class="flex_column shadowed rounded_8 " style="gap:16px; padding:8px; background-color: white;">

  </div>


  <h3 class="subsection-title">PROJECT INFO PAGES</h3>

  <p>
    Once the user is happy with the quilt design, the app offers the resources to achieve the assembly of the project in an easy way  and avoiding the waste of fabric. The goal of all this information is to  <strong>reduce any possible friction </strong> the user could find in the construction process.
  </p>


  <span><strong>Quilt Maps</strong></span>

  <p>
    The assembly of quilts is always be performed <strong>from the smaller elements to bigger ones</strong>, until completing the design. I aimed to represent that and <strong>assist the process with graphics</strong> on how groups add up.

  <span><strong>Instructions</strong></span>

  <p>
    Each type block design has a <strong>way to be built </strong>. All these process must be included as additional documentation that the user can inspect at any point.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to get this part of the app right, <strong>the collaboration of the quilt expert was fundamental</strong>: he provided the list of the best quiltblock designs to include for the first release, and provided all the info on how they are called and assembled.
  </p>

  </div>

  <span><strong>Yardage</strong></span>

  <p>
    The yardage page was probably the most difficult to implement and desging. Using mathematical routines, all the <strong>pieces with the same color are arranged together</strong> in a way that they are saving fabric material. To do so, triangles will rotate and shapes will stick to each other, making <strong>strips of fabric that later will be much easier to cut</strong> (manually or with the machine).Aditionally, the total required size will be visible, so the user knows the ammount of fabric beforehand.

  <p>
  Once I had ready the first functional prototype, I got ready for some usability testing.</p>

  <div>I gathered a small focus group of new and experience quilters. The tests were done remotely, and the tasks requested to perform were:

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Open a 3x3 quilt template</strong> from the home page. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Select and <strong>assign a design to all the the blocks</strong> in thew quilt. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Select and <strong>assign a new design to the central block</strong> design.
      </li>
      <li>
        Change the <strong>color fabrics</strong> in the project as desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        When happy, <strong>inspect the info</strong> on how to build the Quilt.
      </li>
    </ol>

  </div>

  <h3 class="subsection-title">KEY OBSERVATIONS</h3>



  <div>
    <span><strong>Drag and drop</strong></span>
    <p>Several user assumed they could drag and dropquilt blocks to swap positions. This is something that will be researched and implemented in the future.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span><strong>Fabric selection</strong></span>
    <p>Two users instinctively double-tapped fabric swatches expecting them to apply immediately. The extra “Apply” step felt unnecessary.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span><strong>Export flow</strong></span>
    <p>The “Make the Quilt” button caused hesitation. Beginners thought it meant printing, or that it would trigger some sort of inminent process, whil experienced quilters expected the step-by-step set of information.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span><strong>Onboarding</strong></span>
    <p>Users who skipped onboarding later said they couldn’t remember what some icons meant. The toolbar for Quilting, not having the buttons nested in dropdowns, are lacking text labels.</p>
  </div>

<h3 class="subsection-title">LEARNINGS</h3>

<p>
  While working on the Quilting app, none of the previous app projects (Embroidery and Crafting) were closed, as we kept on adding post MVP features in a regular basis. I discovered how tricky it was going to be <strong>managing the UX for the three projects at the same time</strong>. The most  difficult part was to sync changes. For example, we decided to change the naming for a feature that was present in all three apps;hat meant writing Jira tickets for all apps. <strong>I always had to deal with a particular app keeping the other 2 in mind</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  One of my main goals with <strong>sharing the basic structure and design of the initial app</strong> on the other rest, was to save development time. I was <strong>hoping that a set of components could be created and reused</strong> for the different projects. But I did find that this was only going to be possible if the development teams were really in line, and it did not always happen. I did find that, for example the home page, was created three different times, when the initial Embroidery one could have been adapted and re-used.
</p>

<p>
  Looking back I realise <strong>how important it is to be sourrounded by the right people</strong>. The assistance of a quilt specialist on the project really made things smooth, and saved me figuring out many things. He was a <strong>great source of first hand information</strong> that several times provided the right answer and did allow the project to move fordward.
